# Specification Quality Checklist: Score Progression and Scoring System Overhaul

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-11
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit-plan` or `/speckit-clarify`.
- Exact target score numbers (FR-006, FR-009) are intentionally left as calibration guidance rather than hard-coded values; the planning phase will determine concrete numbers based on playtesting data.
- The Hard Boss rotation slot is deferred to the planning phase (assumption documented in spec).
